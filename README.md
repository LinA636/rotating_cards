Using React, chakra-ui and react-flip-toolkit

to use this component you need to install [react-flip-toolkit](https://github.com/aholachek/react-flip-toolkit?tab=readme-ov-file#library-details):

three cards are displayed. Two in the background and one in front centered of the other two.
When clicking one of the outer cards, all the cards rotate in a circle, so that the clicked card moves to the front.
